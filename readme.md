I loved how [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) handles building, etc. but wanted to use React. As a result, I have basically replaced vue with react, keeping the fundamental idea of electron-vue the same. It features hot-loading for the client and automatically restarts the electron app when main code is changed.

### Setup
1) download and cd into directory
2) `npm init`
3) `npm run dev`
